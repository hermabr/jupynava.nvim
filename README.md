# jupynava.nvim

*jupynava.nvim* brings the power of Jupyter notebooks into the efficient and customizable environment of Neovim. This extension is designed for developers and data scientists who love working in Neovim and want to integrate Python, Jupyter notebooks, and data visualization seamlessly into their development workflow. Also supports quarto.

# Installation

NOTE: This plugin is written to make my setup as efficient as possible and not to be a general purpose plugin. This means there are no customization supported and it might be a better idea to fork this or steal some ideas rather than installing it from source:)

For `packer.nvim`:

```lua
use { 'hermabr/jupynava.nvim', run = ':UpdateRemotePlugins' }
```

For `vim-plug`:

```vim
Plug 'hermabr/jupynava.nvim', { 'do': ':UpdateRemotePlugins' }
```
